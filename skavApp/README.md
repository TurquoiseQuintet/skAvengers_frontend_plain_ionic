# skAvengers

##About:

###Purpose:
Skavengers is a mobile scavenger hunt application. It can be used as an easy way to create a large scale hunt with many users.

###Use:
This app allows task creators to generate various tasks associated with one hunt, invite users to join that hunt, view where each user is within their hunt, receive picture notification when a user completes a task and give them points for finishing that task. It also allows you to modify the hunt as needed. As a user of a hunt you are able to be invited to new hunts, you can receive values that allow you to level up and view new tasks within a hunt, you are able to send pictures to your hunt leader and you can see how you are doing within the hunt.

##Technologies used:
The application was built in two parts, using Node, Express, and PostgreSql with Knex for the API [(see other repository)](https://github.com/TurquoiseQuintet/SkAvengers), and angular/ionic for the user interface(this repository).

We preferred to use PostgreSql due to its nature as a relational DB, and Express for its structure and ease of integration as an API. Ionic was used for the front end work due to its ability to transpile to other platforms (specifically Android and iOS).
