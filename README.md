# skAvengers

##About:
Skavengers is a mobile scavenger hunt application. It can be used as an easy way to create a large scale
hunt with many users. This app allows task creators to generate various tasks associated with one hunt, invite users to join that hunt, view where each user is within their hunt, receive picture notification when a user completes a task and give them points for finishing that task. It also allows you to modify the hunt as needed. As a user of a hunt you are able to be invited to new hunts, you can receive values that allow you to level up and view new tasks within a hunt, you are able to send pictures to your hunt leader and you can see how you are doing within the hunt.

##Technologies used:
The application was built using node, express, angular, postgreSql, and ionic. It involves both a backend aspect that is deployed to heroku [(see other repository)](https://github.com/TurquoiseQuintet/SkAvengers), and a front end repository that uses the API from our backend (this repository).
